# The many wage gaps in Connecticut

## Workers in Connecticut are paid relatively well.

The average Connecticut worker is paid over $7,000 more per year than workers across the country. By many measures, Connecticut is a very rich state. Yet, looking at data on wages can show us that not everyone is paid equally.

## You've probably heard of the wage gap.

### Working women in Connecticut are paid 69 cents for every dollar paid to working men.

The wage gap refers to the fact that women, on average, are paid less than men. But again, it's not so simple.

## Education alone doesn't close the wage gap.

The wage gap appears within each education level. In fact, Connecticut women who have attended some college but didn't complete a degree earn less money than men who never started college, and women with graduate degrees on average earn less than men with only a bachelor's degree.

## Women are less likely to work full-time.

### Only 54% of working women in Connecticut work full-time.

One possible explanation for women's lower wages is that fewer women work full-time than men. Part-time workers tend to earn much less money than full-time workers, and there are many reasons why someone might not be working full-time. But that doesn't explain everything.

## The wage gap isn't closed among full-time workers either.

### Women working full-time earn 81 cents on the full-time male dollar.

Among full-time workers, the gap between women's and men's pay is smaller, but still persistent.

## Even within the same occupation type, women are paid less.

The wage gap persists between men and women in the same occupation category, and the gap is worse in some occupations than others. There's an especially large pay gap within the high-salary management, business, and finance occupations.

## The wage gap isn't just men versus women.

### White and Asian-American men have much higher incomes than other groups.

Talking about the wage gap as women's pay versus men's only tells part of the story. White and Asian women are much closer to closing the wage gap than Black and Latina women. On average, white and Asian women in Connecticut actually make _more_ money than Black and Latino men.

## Among full-time workers, black and Latina women's pay lags further behind.

When looking at just full-time workers, white and Asian women are closer to equal pay with men, but black and Latina women are paid far less.

## The wage gap: data shows it's not as simple as we thought.

Breaking down data on Connecticut wages helps us see that there isn't just one wage gap, but many ways that pay inequality shows up.
